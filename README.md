Hello, Wac... I mean, world.  

Most of the work I do in the FOSS community outside of "old" stuff and art is done
anonymously, so don't be surprised if I won't talk about it.

I used to do web design but have since retired from professional coding, and mostly
mess around with embedded stuff written in C.  I prefer the simplicity of low-level
coding, and have no fondness for the chaotic mess the Web has become these days.

I'm pretty active in the retro computer scene and have been designing my own 8-bit
computer system similar to the Amiga which has a custom hybrid CISC CPU.  The CPU
specification is pretty well complete, but the emulator is nowhere near working,
so it will likely be a while before anything is available on GitHub.

For now, I'm mainly toying with a custom fork of WinUAE and testing some major
hardware hacks and CPU modifications, seeing how much stuff I can change before
AmigaOS and various games break.

NOTE: My work on oekaki boards concluded years ago and the code used for my
Wacintaki BBS is more than a decade old.  I still maintain the project, but it
is of horrible quality and should be ignored.  I no longer work with PHP.  8)

I have a primary web site at https://www.ninechime.com/wac/ which mostly shows my art.

An [obsolete] version of my CPU is here: https://www.ninechime.com/cougar/
